# Google Homepage

## Introduction

Google Homepage is an introductory HTML mini-project assigned by The Odin Project. The objective is to deconstruct the google.com search page using developer tools and rebuild it, focusing on the placement, style, and alignment of elements on the page. In completing this project, I hope to develop a better understanding of the structure of HTML as well as improve my ability to manipulate elements on a page.
